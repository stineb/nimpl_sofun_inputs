## Statistical models for carbon allocation and N cycle
### Author: Yunke Peng

###### The data has provided a global dataset of carbon allocations (at different compartments), plant functional traits, soil traits and climate variables. It includes 672 samples, 200 sites overall..

###### The original reference of dataset included: 
* Terra A-P project database (organized by Dr. Sara Vicca and updated by Dr. Keith Bloomfield; non-public)
* Malhi et al. 2011 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. (public available)
* Malhi et al. 2017 New Phytologist (public available)
* ForC dataset -  https://github.com/forc-db/ForC (public available).

###### Pre-processing: In NPP/GPP analysis, there was one sample (see site: TRU08) indicating higher TNPP_1 (total NPP) than GPP, which is not reasonable. This sample was therefore considered as NA in this analysis. 

### Variables
