## Statistical models for carbon allocation and N cycle
### Author: Yunke Peng

###### The data has provided a global dataset of carbon allocations (at different compartments), plant functional traits, soil traits and climate variables. It includes 672 samples, 200 sites overall. The variable name and unit below, are relevant to these four csv, beacuse we used these 4 csv as a start of NPP statistical model analysis.
* NPP_SaraVicca <- read.csv(file="~/data/NPP_Yunke/NPP_SaraVicca/NPP_SaraVicca.csv")
* NPP_Malhi <- read.csv(file="~/data/NPP_Yunke/NPP_Malhi/NPP_Malhi.csv")
* NPP_Keith <- read.csv(file="~/data/NPP_Yunke/NPP_Keith/NPP_Keith.csv")
* NPP_Forc <- read.csv(file="~/data/NPP_Yunke/NPP_ForC/NPP_ForC.csv")

###### within ~/data/NPP_Yunke, NPP_statistical_model.Rmd shows how NPP/GPP, ANPP/GPP, ANPP-foliage/ANPP was predicted, based on input site-based carbon allocation, climate and soil data. Then, for subfiles: climate/ included all necessary climate input of samples, as predicted from geographically weighted regressions in R. NPP_Forc/; NPP_Keith/; NPP_Malhi/; NPP_Saravicca/ included 4 NPP original data sources. Within each of them, it has included orig/ that stores original data, and also included code or readme detailing how original data was restructered or subsetted, before the start-up of NPP model. Then, four csv files above, are the dataframe that prepared as a start-up of NPP models.
