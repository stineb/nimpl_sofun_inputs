### Author: Yunke Peng

###### The data has provided a large global dataset of leaf C/N, LMA, Vcmax25, which was extracted from Peng et al. 2020 submitted to GCB. It has inlcluded 89 sites and 997 samples.

###### The original reference of dataset included: 
* Smith et al. 2019 Ecology Letters (non-public; authored by Nick Smith)
* Field measurement data in Gongga (Xu et al. 2020 unpublished; authored by Wang Han)
* TROBIT database (non-public; authored by Jon Lloyd and Thomas Domingues)
* Cernusak et al. 2011 Agricultural and Forest Meteorology (non-public)
* Wang et al. 2018 Ecology (public available)

#### Variables
* final_species: Genus species 
* Vcmax.25 (umol/m2/s): Maximum rate of carboxylation capacity
* cn (unitless): leaf carbon to nitrogen ratio
* lma (g/m2): leaf mass-per-area
